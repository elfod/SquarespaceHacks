#Hello
This repository contains hacks for use on, currently, Squarespace 6.
You are free to fork, mangle or reuse in anyway you see fit, if you're grateful please say thanks somewhere.

However, these hacks come with no guarantee, implied or otherwise as to their performance, reliability or long term viability on your Squarespace site. These are hacks after all. Don't come crying to em if your site starts running like lame dog, your cat gives birth to a gila monster or a black hole spontaneously appears. Though it may amuse me. Caveat Emptor etc.

Each hack is in a separate folder with instructions, if you have any suggestions or bugs please contact me through my website, thanks.
